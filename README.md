# Particle_Simulation_With_OpenGL
In This Project I created a basic system of Particles with one or more emitters.This project was for getting familiar with basic and advanced OpenGL programming in Object Oriented Mode and How to use Classes, Functions, Events, dynamics array in order to increase the program flexibility and usability. One of the most important thing in Computer Graphics and Animations is knowing how basic model created. What is their History and how they originated?  There are some factors that shows Particle System in computer graphics is a very important Subject to study and research: The particles system can create a lot of things such as Fluids, dust, and Fire! It is very useful functionality in advanced software like Autodesk Maya or 3DMax and animator use this function a lot. Knowing how to create them can help to improve yourself to make them become more efficient in very complicated calculations. Other majors like Mechanical Engineering are work on calculations of these particles in real life. If we work on the calculations we can create the very realistic water, fire, etc.


Also This is the Manual For this Prgram that i had created:

Instruction to use this program
in this program you can use different models as a particles like square, triangle, sphere, cube even Teapot! here are important keys for this program:

1	= Regular Particles
2	= Fountain
3	= Fire
4	= Fire with Smoke
h	= increasing particles size
l	= decreasing particle size
+	= wind right side
-	= wind left side
]	= increasing gravity
[	= decreasing gravity
q	= square shape for particles
t	= triangle shape for particles
s	= sphere shape for particles
c	= cube shape for particles
w	= torus shape for particles
r	= teapot shape for particles
right click = decrease number of particles dynamically after you specify the numbers in the source code
left click = increase number of particles dynamically after you specify the numbers in the source code
Esc = Exit form the program and free the memory
